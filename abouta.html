        <h2>Hey there!</h2>
        <p>I am Amrita Pathania, hailing from Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh. I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, and am currently pursuing my B. Tech in Biotechnology.  I am a self-taught designer, and I love the entire realm of creative problem-solving, pieced together business challenges with visual experiences.</p>

        <h3 >How did I get into Product Design </h3>
        <p >I've always had a creative vision, especially for fashion, so I knew I wanted to study something related to it while growing up. Still, like every third Indian, I got into engineering. I started looking for something that blended my desire to flourish without any artistic boundaries yet stay within the technology industry.<br> 
             Since my freshman year, I started participating in VOGUE, a fashion show organized at our cultural fests and beauty pageants. From there, I explored fashion designing and, eventually, graphic designing. I started reading and learning about design practices and learned about the term Product Design. I always tended to help people and solve problems and involving the user through every stage of the Design process made me more deeply connected to this. I started understanding design and finally realized where I am, What I want to do and where I want to be. </p>

      <div class="description">
        <h3 >More than Design </h3>
        <p >In my free time, I love watching videos and series related to fashion and beauty. I have grown up following and admiring women like Sushmita Sen, Julia Morley, Priyanka Chopra, who inspire millions through their hard work, perseverance, and utmost dedication. If given an opportunity, I would love to be one of them. I also love to sing in my free time, and it is a big stress buster for me. </p>
